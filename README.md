The folder "How ESG Creates Firm Value (Raw Data)" serves as the core empirical repository for the Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling (MASEM) study. Its subfolders are organized to reflect the key stages of the research process and contain raw article information and analytical files necessary to reproduce the findings.
﻿
The first subfolder, "Meta-Analysis Literature list," contains the comprehensive literature list used for systematic coding. Each study was meticulously reviewed and coded to extract relevant statistical information—including correlation coefficients (r-values), sample sizes, and other key metrics—pertaining to the relationships between ESG dimensions, firm performance indicators, and control variables. This systematic coding process ultimately enabled the synthesis of 2,104 effect sizes from 251 primary studies, forming the basis for the meta-analytic correlation matrix (Table 1).
﻿
The second subfolder, "Analysis of the Main-Effect Structural Equation Model," includes the core analytical components of the study. It contains the integrated meta-analytic correlation matrix used as input for structural equation modeling, along with the corresponding executable scripts (e.g., Mplus code) for conducting Two-Stage Structural Equation Modeling (TSSEM). Outputs from this analysis—such as path coefficients (Figure 1, Table 3) and model fit indices (Table 2)—provide the empirical support for testing the main hypotheses (H1–H3).
﻿
The third subfolder, "Robustness Checks," supports the validation of the primary results through sensitivity analysis and publication bias tests. The sensitivity analysis re-estimated the model after identifying outliers using the Sample-Adjusted Meta-Analytic Deviancy (SAMD) statistic (Table 4). Publication bias was assessed via Egger’s regression and Fail-Safe N tests to confirm that the findings are not substantially influenced by unpublished null results (Table 5).
