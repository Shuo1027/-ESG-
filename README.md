The folder "How ESG Creates Firm Value (Raw Data)" serves as the core empirical repository for the Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling (MASEM) study. Its subfolders are organized to mirror the key research stages, containing the complete raw data and analytical files.

The first subfolder, "Meta-Analysis Coding Tables," houses the foundational coding tables comprising six specialized spreadsheets. These tables systematically document correlation coefficients (r-values), sample sizes, and other essential statistics for bivariate relationships across ESG dimensions, firm performance metrics, and control variables. The subsequent synthesis of these extracted statistics, performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software, yielded the 2,104 effect sizes from 251 primary studies. This structured data compilation ultimately enabled the construction of the meta-analytic correlation matrix (Table 1).

The second subfolder, "Analysis of the Main-Effect Structural Equation Model," contains the core components for the primary analysis. This includes the integrated meta-analytic correlation matrix used as the SEM input and the executable scripts (e.g., Mplus code) for the Two-Stage Structural Equation Modeling (TSSEM). The output of this analysis, including the path coefficients (Figure 1, Table 3) and model fit indices (Table 2), provides the empirical basis for testing the core hypotheses (H1-H3).

The third subfolder, "Robustness Checks," validates the main findings through sensitivity and publication bias analyses. The sensitivity analysis re-estimated the model after identifying outliers via the Sample-Adjusted Meta-Analytic Deviancy (SAMD) statistic (Table 4), while the publication bias assessment employed Eggerâ€™s regression and Fail-Safe N tests to ensure the conclusions are robust against unpublished null results (Table 5).
