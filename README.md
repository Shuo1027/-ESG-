The folder "How ESG Creates Firm Value (Raw Data)" is the core empirical material repository supporting the Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling (MASEM) study in the paper. It contains complete raw data and analytical files, with subfolders clearly organized in line with the key stages of the research.​
The first part is "Meta-Analysis Coding Tables", which stores the foundational coding tables of the study, including 6 specialized spreadsheets. These spreadsheets systematically record key data for bivariate relationships between multiple groups of variables, such as correlation coefficients (r-values) and sample sizes. Specifically, they cover relationships between ESG dimensions (Environmental, Social, Governance) and firm performance dimensions, individual sub-dimensions within ESG and firm performance, as well as control variables (firm size, leverage, firm age) with performance and ESG dimensions. Using these tables, the study compiled 2,104 effect sizes from 251 studies, and finally constructed the meta-analytic correlation matrix, corresponding to Table 1 in the paper.​
The second part is "Analysis of the Main-Effect Structural Equation Model", which includes core data and scripts required for the primary analysis. Among them, the integrated meta-analytic correlation matrix serves as the input data for the structural equation model, while the running codes (e.g., Mplus codes) for specifying and estimating the Two-Stage Structural Equation Modeling (TSSEM) are key tools for conducting the analysis. The path coefficients (corresponding to Figure 1 and Table 3 in the paper) and model fit indices (corresponding to Table 2 in the paper) output from this part are important bases for testing core hypotheses (H1-H3) and constitute the core findings of the paper.​
The third part is "Robustness Checks", which verifies the reliability of the main results through sensitivity tests and publication bias tests. The former re-estimates the model after removing outlier studies using the Sample-Adjusted Meta-Analytic Deviancy (SAMD) statistic, corresponding to Table 4 in the paper; the latter adopts methods such as Egger’s regression and Fail-Safe N to prove that the conclusions are not affected by potential unpublished null results, corresponding to Table 5 in the paper.
